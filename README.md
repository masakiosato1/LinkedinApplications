# LinkedinApplications
Scrape job listings from Linkedin and filter them to my needs. In order to personalize results, edit personalize_results.py in the root folder. 

# Next Tasks
- parse and edit job description
    - find the sentence with year
- add something to stay awake
- deal with "No longer accepting applications"

# Ideas
I kinda wanna make it more of a data pipeline. It would be cool to have a pretty big table in like snowflake or something and I can query it using SQL.s
